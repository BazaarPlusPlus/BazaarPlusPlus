# Triage Labels

The triage skills speak in five canonical roles. This table maps each role to the label string on this repo's GitHub Issues.

| Role              | Label             | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`    | `needs-triage`    | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`      | `needs-info`      | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human` | `ready-for-human` | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`         | `wontfix`         | Will not be actioned                     |

`wontfix` already exists on the repository; create the others with `gh label create` the first time a skill applies them.
